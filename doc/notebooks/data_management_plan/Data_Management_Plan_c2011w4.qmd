# Introduction

This document introduces a provisional data management plan for Edad con Salud.
The intention is to implement this plan in the newly created datasets for the
"4th wave" of the original sample, so-called "2011 Cohort".

## Scope

This document refers to the following data sources from **Wave 4, Cohort 2011**:

* Raw responses from the field interviews

* Raw responses from the verbal autopsies

The information contained in this document affects only these two data sources.
No other datasets or data sources are considered here.

# General description

The aims of this plan are

1. Describe the current data storage structure

1. Propose a more systematic data storage structure, that can be flexible
   enough to be embedded within the current data structure
   
1. Propose a systematic manipulation of the datasets, in order to respect the
   aforementioned storage structure.

## Current state of the data storage structure

### Main folders

The project Edad con Salud has the following two main folders:

* `Bases de datos maestras Edad con Salud`: This is the main folder where the
  raw datasets from the interviews are stored. With only a few exceptions, any
  other dataset related to the project is NOT storaged in this main folder. We
  refer to this main folder as the _database folder_.
  
* `Documentacion Edad con Salud`: This is the main folder for documentation
  other than the raw datasets from the interviews. In principle and with few
  exceptions, most of the generated and additional datasets from the project are
  stored in this main folder. We refer to this main folder as the _documentation
  folder_.
  
These two folders are stored under the OneDrive storage of user "Marta Miret
Garcia". Therefore, the complete folder names are
`Marta Miret Garcia - Bases de datos maestras Edad con Salud` and
`Marta Miret Garcia - Documentacion Edad con Salud`, for the database and the
documentation folder, respectively.

Their complete path will depend on the local configuration of each user's
OneDrive storage on their computer. For a typical user with default
configuration options in any Windows system, the database folder path will be:

`C:/Users/[USER_ID]/UAM/Marta Miret Garcia - Bases de datos maestras Edad con Salud`

being `[USER_ID]` an identifier related to the local user, assigned directly by
Windows, base on its user name. Similarly for the documentation folder, the path
will be:

`C:/Users/[USER_ID]/UAM/Marta Miret Garcia - Documentacion Edad con Salud`

We will use the wildcards `[DB_FOLDER]` (database folder) and `[DOC_FOLDER]`
(documentation folder) to refer to these two paths in subsequent file and folder
paths.

### Main folder structures

In general, these two folders have a parallel structure, that identifies
"Waves" and "Cohorts". Within the database folder, the structure for Cohort
2011, Wave 4, is `Ola_4/Cohorte 2011`. Within the documentation folder, there is
a folder for Wave 4, called `Edad con salud - Ola 4`. Within this one, there are
several folders for different purposes (e.g., `Autopsia verbal` for the verbal
autopsies) and, within it, a `Cohorte_2011` folder for the Cohort 2011 data
(as there intends to be another one for the Cohort 2019 data collected in
the same FIS call, i.e. its Wave 2).

In summary, the two folders of interest for this plan are:

* Interview data folder: `[DB_FOLDER]/Ola_4/Cohorte 2011`

* Verbal autopsy data folder:
  `[DOC_FOLDER]/Edad con salud - Ola 4/Autopsia verbal/Cohorte_2011`

These folder structures are inherited from the history of the Courage project
and previous waves of the Edad con Salud project, and this partial data
management plan intends to respect it.

### Other folders

Within the "interview data folder" there is a folder named `Parciales`, which
stores the (partial) historical versions of the interview dataset. Its path is
therefore

`[DB_FOLDER]/Ola_4/Cohorte 2011/Parciales`

### Dataset files

#### Interview datasets

Currently, the interview datasets are only partial versions of the final
interview dataset, each of them reporting cumulative progress on the fieldwork
with the main interview. These files are stored in folder
`[DB_FOLDER]/Ola_4/Cohorte 2011/Parciales`, and each has a name with that
follows the pattern `21057905Parcial1_[YYYYMMDD].dta`, being `[YYYYMMDD]` the
date in which the file was created (by the field interview provider), with the
format indicated by the wildcard (being `YYYY` the 4-digit year, and `MM` and
`DD` two-digit month and day, respectively).

#### Verbal autopsy datasets

Currently, there is only one dataset with a partial version of the final verbal
autopsy dataset, reporting cumulative progress on the fieldwork with the verbal
autopsy interviews. Its name is `PESC21057905_AutopsiaVerbal_Parcial1.dta`
(there does not seem to be any date pattern).

## Proposal of new data storage structure

The following data structure intends to systematize the storage and access of
the Cohort 2011, Wave 4 dataset files. In order to this, we propose a new
structure internal to the "main folder structure". In contrast, in order to
respect the previously inherited structure, the so-called "interview data" and
"verbal autopsy data" folders will not be modified.

### Internal folder structure

Within each of the two main folders, a new folder named `history` will be
created to store historical versions of the datasets. Any other folder will not
be necessary and thus will not be present after the implementation of this plan.
In this case, folder `[DB_FOLDER]/Ola_4/Cohorte 2011/Parciales` is the only one
affected.
